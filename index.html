            <h2>It is fun!!</h2>
            <p>
                 You may think it's boring, but you can run with friends when practicing.<br>
                 My favrite is when I chalenge my self. Right after a meet you whant to<br>
                 go and run again. The best part about a meet is the sprint at the end,<br> 
                 because you are excited to get a drink of water.
